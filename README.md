# One Dollar Word Finder

This project was for 5 Cunningham at St Bernard's school, to find all one dollar words in the english language, given that A is 1 cent, and Z is 26 cents.

## Instructions
1. Download Python 3
2. Open a Terminal (command line console)
3. run the script by entering `python main.py` once you have gone into the directory.

## Extras
* If you run `python main.py | less` in the console, you can then type `/[word to search]`, replacing `[word to search]` with whatever word you want to search for, to see if it was found.  This will be case sensitive.
* Similarly, you can enter `python main.py > [filename]`, and give a filename you want to output the results into
* Lastly, you can enter `ipython`, and once this is running, type `from main import findScore` to find the score of any word.

### Good luck 5 Cunningham!
